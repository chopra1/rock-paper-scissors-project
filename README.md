Rock, Paper, or Scissors
Rock paper scissors is a classic two player game. Each player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. The items are compared, and whichever player chooses the more powerful item wins.

The possible outcomes are:

1. Rock destroys scissors.
2. Scissors cut paper.
3. Paper covers rock.
4. If there’s a tie, then the game ends in a draw.
My code will break the game into four parts:

Get the user’s choice.
Get the computer’s choice.
Compare the two choices and determine a winner.
Start the program and display the results.
Made this game better by adding a secret cheat code. If a user types 'bomb' as their choice, then make sure they win, no matter what.
